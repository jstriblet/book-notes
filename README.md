## How I take notes

Generally, I only take notes on the technical books I read. Where taking a systematic approach to reading the material will lead to better retention and understanding. I usually have the book open in kindle reader on the left half of the screen and my text editor of choice (currently vim) open on the right. I don't sit/study/read for hours at a time if the material is technical like this and if I'm lucky I finish half a chapter before calling a quits. This is usually done in the evenings after work so I'm already at the end of my attention span resources for the day.

Here's hoping that consistant note taking like this will get me though more technical books with more understanding and retention of what I have read.
