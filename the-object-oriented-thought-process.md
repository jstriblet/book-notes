# The Object Oriented Thought Process

by Matt Weisfield

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Object Oriented Concepts 
- Objects and OO programing emerged with the rise of "Internet as a business" and entertainment platform, objects work well over a network.

### Fundamental Concepts

- Object oriented languages are defined by the following: 
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
	- Inheritance
- Composition (supplementary to the terms listed above)
	- Matt also considers composition to be another central component in OO programing languages

### Objects and Legacy Systems
	**What Are the fundamental concepts of OO Programing?**
	**What is an Object Wrapper?**
	**What is an Object**
	**What is the difference between procedural programing and OO programing?**
	**What is the difference between procedural programing and OO programing?**
	- OO programing and procedural (structured) programming are complementary to one another and should be used in conjunction with one another

#### What is an Object Wrapper?
	- An object wrapper is OO code that contains (wraps around) structured code like loops and if statements to make it look and function like OO code. 

#### What is an Object?
	- At it's most basic definition, an object has both data and behavior (attributes and methods).

#### What is the process of procedural programing?
	- Procedural programing ideally consist of individual / distinct functions or processes in which data is placed into them and outputs come out.

#### What is the difference between procedural programing and OO programing?
	- In OO design, the data and the methods live on the same object, conversely with procedural, or structured, design the attributes and functions / behaviors are separated.
	- What are some benefits to switching to / using an OO model as opposed to structured?
	- There is no such thing as global data in an OO model. Which means there is amost a guarantee of data integrity
	- It is important in OO programing that one object does not change the attributes of another object. 
	- A good rule of thumb is to build small objects that do one task well as opposed to a large object that does many task.

### Moving from Procedural to Object-Oriented Development
	** What is procedural programing? **
	** What is the primary benifit to OO programing? **
	** How is the state of the object represented? **

#### Procedural Programing 
	- procedural programing is the method of programing in which the data and the processes to manipulate that data are separated.

#### OO Programing 
	- The primary benefit of OO programing is that the data and the methods and operations that can and should manipulate that data are encapsulated in the same object
	- An example of an object being sent over an network would be a webapp / page. Browsers does not know what the app will be before hand and relies on the object (HTML/Javascrip/CSS) to build and run itself

### What Exactly is an Object?
	** What is a getter and setter? **
	** What is UML (Unified Modeling Language) **

#### Object Data 
	- the data stored within an object represents the sate of the object. Also called the objects attributes.

#### Object Behaviors
	- The behavior of an object outlines what an object can do.
	- Getters and setters are methods on an object that regulate access to object attributes. 
		- They are also called accessor and manipulators, respectivly 

	- The unified modeling language is used to help visualize and manipulate class diagrams.

### What Exactly is a Class?

#### Creating Objects

#### Attributes
	
#### Methods

#### Messages

### Using Class Diagrams as a Visual Tool

### Encapsulation and Data Hiding

#### Interfaces

#### Implementations 

### Inheritance

#### Superclasses and Subclasses

#### Abstraction

#### Is-a Relationships

### Polymorphism

### Composition

#### Abstraction

#### Has-a Relationship
