# The Object Oriented Thought Process

by Matt Weisfield

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Object Oriented Concepts 
- Objects and OO programing emerged with the rise of "Internet as a business" and entertainment platform, objects work well over a network.

### Fundamental Concepts
- Object oriented languages are defined by the following: 
	- Polymorphism
	- Encapsulation
	- Inheritance
	- Composition (supplementary to the terms listed above)
- Matt also considers composition to be another central component in OO programing languages

### Objects and Legacy Systems
- OO programing and procedural (structured) programming are complementary to one another and should be used in conjunction with one another

#### What is an Object Wrapper?
- An object wrapper is OO code that contains (wraps around) structured code like loops and if statements to make it look and function like OO code. 

#### What is an Object?
- At it's most basic definiton, an object has both data and behavior (attributes and methods).

#### What is the process of procedural programing?
- Procedural programing ideally consist of individual / distinct functions or processes in which data is placed into them and outputs come out.

#### What is the difference between procedural programing and OO programing?
- in OO design, the data and the methods live on the same object, conversely with procedural, or structured, design the attributes and functions / behaviors are separated.

- What are some benefits to switching to / using an OO model as opposed to structured?
	- There is no such thing as global data in an OO model. Which means there is amost a guarantee of data integrity
- It is important in OO programing that one object does not change the attributes of another object. 

### Moving from Procedural to Object-Oriented Development

#### Procedural Programing 

#### OO Programing 

### What Exactly is an Object?

#### Object Data

#### Object Behaviors

### What Exactly is a Class?

#### Creating Objects

#### Attributes
	
#### Methods

#### Messages

### Using Class Diagrams as a Visual Tool

### Encapsulation and Data Hiding

#### Interfaces

#### Implementations 

### Inheritance

#### Superclasses and Subclasses

#### Abstraction

#### Is-a Relationships

### Polymorphism

### Composition

#### Abstraction

#### Has-a Relationship
